# AWS EKS Terraform Module

---

## About

A simple example of using the [EKS terraform module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws/latest). \
The Vault Provider is used to store the AWS Credentials. \
Maybe this [repository](https://github.com/GuhAlex/kind-vault) will help you to set your Vault environment quickly. :grin:

## Setup :wrench:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
